# AAAAAAAA

## Are you ok?
Yes

## Right... What is this repo?
This is AAAAAAAA, a backend made in Rust for my blog. It's in charge for building the blog home page dynamically and serve the blog article pages.

## Ha you're one of those people who likes to write code in Rust because it is "fast" and "safe"?
No. I just finished a [project in C++](https://github.com/HugoBde/blog_bob) and realised that exceptions were **evil**, that's all.
