# AAAAAAAA

## Are you ok?
Yes

## Right... What is this repo?
This is `AAAAAAAA`, a backend made in Rust for my blog. It's responsibilities are to build the blog home page dynamically and to serve the blog article pages.

## Ha you're one of those people who likes to write code in Rust because it is "fast" and "safe"?
No. I just finished a [project in C++](https://github.com/HugoBde/blog_bob) and realised that exceptions were **evil**, that's all.

## How did you come up with this "name"?
I called this project `AAAAAAAA` so that I never forget why I picked Rust. So that I never forget the torment, the suffering and the wrath I experienced when trying to understand what could throw exceptions in my previous project. `AAAAAAAA` is the rendition of my martyrdom.

## TODO
- [X] Refactor code to operate with a single DB connection
